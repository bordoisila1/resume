        "<p>It's been a while since I started thinking about developing my personal website. What I lacked were the answers to the following questions:" +
        "<ol>" +
        "<li><strong>Where do I post all my random thoughts, since I ditched Facebook sometime ago ?</strong></li>" +
        "<li><strong>What to do with my website ?</strong></li>" +
        "<li><strong>What technology(s) to use for developing it ?</strong></li>" +
        "</ol></p>" +
        "<p>Well, I decided against the commonly available technologies, like <em>Wordpress</em> because that's no fun. Duh ! " +
        "Then the other good CMS that I know very well is AEM or Adobe Experience Manager" +
        ", that well....costs around a few thousand Dollars. Nope. So, I looked around and realized that probably <em>React JS</em> would work, provided I learn it first !! So, there it went. I started reading about it" +
        " and decided to stick to it and develop my things in an iterative manner. So, here it is, the outcome of various iterations, that will keep on continuing in future. " +
        "Currently, I have been able to develop an <i>Article Engine</i> with React and all the articles that you will see here are outcomes of the article engine, that seems pretty decent to me. " +
        "</p>" +
        "<p>To my first question, I plan to write about my <em>life, likings, thoughts, reviews of various entities, recipes</em> etc. Well, I am not very sure at this moment but I am super excited about " +
        "developing this website further and express my thoughts digitally.You can find more about me in the <a href='/about-me'>About Me</a> section. </p>" +
